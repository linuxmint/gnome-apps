banshee (2.1.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * [6a4942d] Update manpage
  * [b5856fb] Imported Upstream version 2.1.3
    + New Features:
      - New custom support for the Barnes & Noble Nook
      - Support default internet radio stations. At first start, XSPF playlists
        in $datadir/banshee/stations/ are imported automatically. We don't
        provide default radio stations ourselves but this allows distros or
        other third parties to do so.
    + Enhancements:
      - bgo#549173: Add "Stop when finished" option in the notification popup
        menu
      - bgo#636071: Get info from the database or the file when opening a URI
        (LP: #683970)
      - bgo#639805: Hide labels in the source pane when the group is empty
        (LP: #712466)
      - bgo#647306: Add support for the Notion Ink Adam tablet
      - bgo#651497: Motorola Atrix support (LP: #779072)

      - bgo#653284: Remove keyboard shortcut for toggling scrobbling
      - bgo#653997: Samsung Galaxy Ace support
      - bgo#656526: Add "Smiley Face Curve" default equalizer
      - bgo#656670: Cache the ArtworkID in the database for faster startup
      - Various enhancements to our experimental GStreamer# backend, bringing it
        close to feature parity with our current C backend. It is still not
        built by default and not recommended for daily use, but testing is
        welcome.
    + Notable Bugs Fixed (39 fixed since 2.1.0):
      - bgo#587264: Fix metadata fetching from MusicBrainz (LP: #778090)
      - bgo#647111: Put the Audio CD source label in the right place
        (LP: #765885)

      - bgo#648498: Make sure the MPRIS sends the new metadata on track change
        (LP: #768509)

      - bgo#651914: Fix "Least Favorite" smart playlist to not pick unrated
        songs

      - bgo#656176: Don't ignore the last value of the .is_audio_player file
      - bgo#656246: Fix random crash while changing tracks
      - EqualizerSetting: Set the amplifier level for default equalizers
