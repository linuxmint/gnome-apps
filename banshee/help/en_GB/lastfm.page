  <title>Last.fm</title>    
  
  <p>Last.fm is a popular online service that offers both free and paid versions. Last.fm offers information on music artists and albums and if you create a user profile Last.fm allows you to track the music you listen to in Banshee for free. If you subscribe as a paying member, you can also listen to streaming music from Last.fm in various music clients, including Banshee. Last.fm offers multiple channels to stream, including recommended music for you based on your listening habits, your favourites and more.</p>

  <title>Enable Last.fm Song Reporting From Banshee</title> 
  <p>After you have successfully linked Banshee to your Last.fm profile you must
  ensure that you have enabled Banshee to report your songs.  To enable Banshee to
  report the songs to your Last.fm profile go to Banshee's preferences, select the
  <gui>Source Specific</gui> tab, select <gui>Last.fm</gui> from the dropdown, and
  press the <gui>Enable Song Reporting From Banshee</gui> checkbox. If you have an active internet
  connection Banshee will now send Last.fm information regarding the songs
  you play.  To view your play history visit your profile on the Last.fm
  website.  Last.fm will automatically update your music metadata if any of your
  artist, song title, or album information is incorrect (although we recommend that
  you use the Metadata Fixer extension to correct your files instead).

  <title>Enable Last.fm Song Reporting From Your Device</title>
  <p>After successfully linking Banshee to your Last.fm profile and enabling Banshee to 
  report songs to Last.fm you can also enable scrobbling from a connected device. Banshee 
  will, upon connection of your device, attempt to scrobble the songs you have played since the 
  device was last connected and submit them to Last.fm.
  </p>

  <p>To enable scrobbling of a connected device go to Banshee's preferences, select the 
  <gui>Source Specific</gui> tab, select <gui>Last.fm</gui> from the dropdown, and press 
  the <gui>Enable Song Reporting From Device</gui> checkbox.  If you have an 
  active internet connection Banshee will, upon connection of your device, now attempt to gather 
  information regarding the songs that you have played since it was last connected.
  </p>

  <p>As with regular Banshee scrobbling submissions Last.fm will automatically update 
  your music metadata if any of your artist, title, or album information is incorrect (although we 
  again recommend that you use the Metadata Fixer extension to correct your files instead).
  </p>

  <p>Please note that currently Banshee only supports this feature with Apple products that are
  supported by the AppleDevice extension.

  <title>Listen to Last.fm Radio</title> 
  <p>Last.fm radio is free for residents of the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. Residents of other countries will have to pay for a premium account with Last.fm to listen to radio.

  <p>In Banshee's sources pane on the left hand side, you will now have a Last.fm section, including your Last.fm radio stations. You will need an active internet connection to listen to Last.fm radio. Choose the radio station you wish to listen to and Banshee will communicate with Last.fm to populate songs for that radio station. Press the <gui>Play</gui> button in Banshee or <key>Spacebar</key> to start streaming a Last.fm radio station. You can also press the <gui>Next</gui> button in Banshee, <key>N</key> or choose <guiseq><gui>Playback</gui><gui>Next</gui></guiseq> to play the next song in your radio station queue.</p>
